# README

Dynadeck unity game, currently being prototyped.

To play the game, use the "wasd" keys to navigate the initial maze/exploration section, using the mouse to control the third person camera.
Use the "e" key to interact with the NPC and to forward his dialogue.
Once you have the key given by the NPC, walk into the door to enter the turn based battle in the dungeon.
Select the card you'd like to play out of the five available cards.
Ice beats water, water beats fire, fire beats ice. The difference in the card values is subtracted from the loser's health, if the value isn't negative.
Keep playing cards until you or the dungeon boss' health falls below zero, where a game ending screen will appear signalling the end of the prototype.
