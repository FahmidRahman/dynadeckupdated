Dynadeck Unity Game, Final Game Project

Player movement is done through "WASD" keys, mouse utilised to control the first person camera and left click on the mouse button to swing the sword. 
The "e" button is used to interact with items or NPCs and activate buttons.
Game involves completing complex self made puzzles and navigating through mazes/obstacles to complete each level.
After a level is completed the player is made to play a card battle as a boss fight and must win to advance to the next level.
Card battle is elemental based where ice beats water, water beats fire, fire beats ice. The difference in the card values is subtracted from the loser's health, if the value isn't negative.
